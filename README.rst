
Hey All I am trying to setup an Escape room puzzle using 6 RFID RC522 readers with 888 Bytes NTAG216 tags.

The goal is as follows.  I have 6 items that will have these tags attched to the bottom of them.  The objects need to be placed on top of the readers in a specific order (reader 1 will match up with the UID of tag 1, reader 2 with tag 2, etc all th eay to 6).
The exact sequence (1st object placed, then 2nd then third, etc) does not matter so long as the object with the tag corresponding to the correct reader is placed.  Once all tags have been correctly placed on their matching reader, a relay will trigger a magnetic lock that will release hold of a magnet.
